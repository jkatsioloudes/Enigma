Enigma is the common name for the coding machine used by German forces in the Second World War. Two machines set up in the same way allowed the sending of messages securely between their users. 

My code can be used to encrypt (or decrypt) messages provided on the standard input stream, outputting the encrypted (or decrypted) messages on the standard output stream. 

This project is implemented in an object oriented manner using C++ classes and inheritance.
